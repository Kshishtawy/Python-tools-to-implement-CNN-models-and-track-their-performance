# Pet Image Classifier

All of the TODOs are listed in `check_images.py`. The file got a lot of comments explaining each step. Each function is implemented in its own file and all are commented with explanations as well.

## Principal Objectives

1. **Identify Dogs:**
   - Correctly identify images of dogs, even if the breed is misclassified.
   - Differentiate images that do not contain dogs.

2. **Classify Dog Breeds:**
   - Accurately classify the breed of dogs in the identified images.

3. **Evaluate CNN Models:**
   - Determine the most effective CNN model architecture among ResNet, AlexNet, and VGG for achieving objectives 1 and 2.

4. **Consider Time Resources:**
   - Assess the time resources required by each algorithm to accomplish objectives 1 and 2.
   - Determine if an alternative solution would provide a "good enough" result within acceptable time constraints.

5. **Evaluate Image Classification:**
   - Utilize Python skills to determine the optimal image classification algorithm for identifying images as "dogs" or "not dogs."
   - Recognize that image classifiers may not always categorize images correctly.

6. **Assess Classification Accuracy and Runtime:**
   - Evaluate how well the "best" classification algorithm performs in correctly identifying dog breeds.
   - Measure the time each algorithm takes to solve the classification problem.
   - Recognize the trade-off between accuracy and runtime in computational tasks.
